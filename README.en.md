#ChaosRuins

ChaoRuins is a game developed by a newable programer without any game engine.

Emm...I think my words may be strange,because I am from China,and I almost learned English by textbook,It's really shit.

But do not worry,I am learning now,maybe the next time,the #README.en.md will be normal.
I just want to say that everyone can tell me your idea for this game.

And I'd like to put this game on steam to make some money(if I can develop this game well),but this public repository will also be here.
